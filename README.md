This repo houses the coding challenge code stubs, docs, and reference for my tech screenings.

## Live Coding Exercise

- Minesweeper Typescript
- Minesweeper Javascript

## React/Typescript: Voomove Weather Application Test

## About

This application is intended to take 1-5 hours of time for a mid level React dev with Typescript experience.

## Testing Insights

- See how they use Git and if they can follow simple, clear instructions
- See their creativity in solutions with openness to "improve the app"
- Test their willingness to dive in
- Ensure that they have proper tech background (or can learn for this project somewhat on what they don't know)

## Tech Requirements

- React / Next JS
- Typescript
- Testing Library (Jest, RTL, Enzyme)
- Code Linter
- Styled Components is a Plus
- Mobile Responsive
