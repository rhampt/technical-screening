# Voomove Weather Application

### Context

`Company` has a client named Voomove. Voomove's business is complex and has many moving pieces, people don't always think about the complexity of shipping vehicles across country. One thing that we need to consider is that weather impacts our delivery times. If it rains, snows, or is windy, that may impact when a customer receives their delivery. We've decided to create our own weather app so that our driver's can get the weather information they need, customized to their needs. Since it's brand new, the functionality will be basic - but we will iterate on this over time!

### Product Requirements

As a user:

- I would like to view the weather by city, state, and zip.
- I would like to be able to view the weather in both C and F.
- I would like to know the current weather condition for the area I've searched.

### Your Mission

Create a React application that satisfies the requirements above, plus any nice to have items that you feel would improve this application. Our designers have not yet been able to provide you with a mockup, but that's okay - let's focus on the functionality. There's no need to make it high fidelity, but do what you can to make it look presentable.

Please use React / Next JS. We encourage you to use your favorite tools and packages to build a solid React application. You can assume that you do not have to support legacy browsers. Feel free to use modern features such as fetch or flexbox. Please ensure that we're able to build and run your application locally. You will be using https://openweathermap.org for your API, and will need to create an account and generate an API key.
